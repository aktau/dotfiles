# There are two important TERM values: the outer and the inner one [1,2]. To make
# 24-bit colour work, we need:
#
#  1. tmux to recognize that the outer term is capable of 24-bit colours. We can
#     enforce this using terminal-overrides if the Tc bit isn't set on the outer
#     terminal (for example: xterm-256color). In the ideal world, we'd be able
#     to let tmux force this override whenever the $COLORTERM environment
#     variable is set. Sadly the ",*:Tc" override doesn't seem to be respected.
#  2. Applications inside tmux need to recognize the inner terminal. The
#     tmux-direct terminfo sets the Tc bit, unlike tmux-256color. Some
#     applications also take an override via $COLORTERM (e.g.: Neovim).

# Force RGB (24-bit) color capability if TERM=*-256color. This is imprecise
# because (e.g.) macOS terminal, iterm2 and hterm all claim to be xterm-256color
# by default. Yet, macOS terminal does not support 24-bit. Ideally, we'd base
# this decision on the presence of the $COLORTERM environment variable, which is
# properly set (or not set) for all relevant terminals. Use terminal-features
# instead of terminal-overrides (3.2+ only) [1].

# In recent tmux versions (I estimate 2.4+), there:
#
# - Is no more need to use reattach-to-user-namespace(1) when using iTerm2
#   option "Applications in terminal may use clipboard". In 2.6+, not even that
#   will be required anymore, as tmux will include that functionality natively.
# - Copying works cross application without setting up copy-pipe to
#   pbcopy(1)/xsel(1). This requires the terminal to be able to write to the
#   clipboard (see OSC 52 clipboard control). urxvt on linux does *not* support
#   this. Which means that urxvt still requires copy-pipe instead of
#   copy-selection-*, or a Perl extension
#   (example:
#   https://github.com/parantapa/dotfiles/blob/master/urxvt-perl/52-osc). Also
