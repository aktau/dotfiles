aktau's dotfiles
================

Note to all
-----------

Just run `./engage.sh` and you should be ready to go. A backup of any existing
dotfiles that got replaced should be created.

Note to others (not aktau)
--------------------------

This sets up some things that are _really_ specific to me (aktau), so please
inspect `engage.sh` before running it.

About the /bin folder
---------------------

I know those are not dotfiles or even non-dot configuration files. But I still
like that I can clone and apply one git repository to make an environment feel
much more familiar.
